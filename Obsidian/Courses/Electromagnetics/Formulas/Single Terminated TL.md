## Reflection Coefficient at the Load
$$
\Gamma_B = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}
$$
- $Z_L =$ load impedance, $Z_0 =$ characteristic impedance.  
- $|\Gamma_B|=0$ â†’ matched load, no reflection.  
- $|\Gamma_B|=1$ â†’ total reflection.  

ðŸ”— Related: [[Transmission_Lines]] â€” uses $Z_0$ from line fundamentals.

## Reflection Coefficient at TL Input
$$
\Gamma_A = \Gamma_B e^{-2\gamma \ell}
$$

ðŸ”— Related: [[Wave Parameters]] â€” depends on $\beta$ (phase constant) through $\gamma = j\beta$.

## Input Impedance at TL Input
$$
Z_A = Z_0 \frac{Z_L + Z_0 \tanh(\gamma \ell)}{Z_0 + Z_L \tanh(\gamma \ell)}
$$
For **lossless line**:  
$$
Z_A = Z_0 \frac{Z_L + jZ_0 \tan(\beta \ell)}{Z_0 + jZ_L \tan(\beta \ell)}
$$

## Voltage Standing-Wave Ratio (VSWR)
$$
S = \frac{1+|\Gamma|}{1-|\Gamma|}
$$
- $S=1$ â†’ matched line.  
- $S \to \infty$ â†’ short/open circuit.  

ðŸ”— Related: [[Wave Parameters]] â€” standing wave pattern spacing is set by $\lambda$.

## Standing Wave Locations
- **Voltage maxima:**  
$$
d_1 = \frac{\phi_B}{2\pi}\lambda + n\frac{\lambda}{2}
$$
- **Voltage minima:**  
$$
d_2 = \frac{\phi_B}{2\pi}\lambda + \frac{\lambda}{4} + n\frac{\lambda}{2}
$$

where $\phi_B = \arg(\Gamma_B)$.

## Wave Impedance Along the Line
$$
Z(d) = Z_0 \frac{1 + \Gamma_B e^{-j2\beta d}}{1 - \Gamma_B e^{-j2\beta d}}
$$
- Oscillates between max/min depending on $d$.  
- Reduces to $Z_0$ for matched load ($\Gamma=0$).
